## Personal bash-script collection for automating things ##

A bunch of bash-scripts I use when `.bashrc alias` is not an
option. Among the most frequently used scripts are backup scripts,
scripts for a quick web-scraping with `lynx`, `sed` and `grep`, as
well as mass file manipulation scripts (like wiping out emacs tmp
files recursively).
